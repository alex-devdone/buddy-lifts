# Rules - instructions the AI MUST follow
# These are injected into every prompt
rules:
  - "Always use TypeScript with strict mode enabled"
  - "Use tRPC ONLY for mutations/writes - never add tRPC queries"
  - "Use Supabase client directly for all read operations (hybrid pattern)"
  - "Use Drizzle ORM for database schema and migrations"
  - "Use Better-Auth for authentication - follow patterns in packages/auth"
  - "All tRPC inputs must be validated with Zod schemas"
  - "Use Biome for formatting/linting - run 'bun run check' before committing"
  - "Use Bun as the package manager, not npm or yarn"
  - "Follow monorepo structure: apps/* for applications, packages/* for shared"
  - "Use TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui - maintain consistency with existing components"
  - "Use tab indentation and double quotes (Biome config)"
  - "Use 'import type' for type-only imports (verbatimModuleSyntax)"
  - "Use 'protectedProcedure' for authenticated tRPC operations"
