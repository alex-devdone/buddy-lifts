2026-01-25 - Phase 1 Database Schema: Created all database tables (training, exercise, trainingSession, sessionParticipant, exerciseProgress, friend) in packages/db/src/schema/training.ts with proper relations and indexes. Exported schemas and ran db:push to sync with Supabase. Linting and build passed.
2026-01-25 - Phase 1 Authentication Enhancement: Added Google OAuth provider to Better-Auth in packages/auth/src/index.ts with socialProviders configuration. Added GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET optional environment variables to packages/env/src/server.ts. Updated apps/web/src/lib/auth-client.ts with baseURL configuration for OAuth flow. Linting passed, build succeeded.
2026-01-25 - Phase 2 Training Router: Created packages/api/src/routers/training.ts with create, update, and delete mutations for trainings using protectedProcedure. All operations include proper authorization checks to ensure users can only modify their own trainings. Registered training router in packages/api/src/routers/index.ts. Linting passed, type checking passed, build succeeded.
2026-01-25 - Phase 2 Exercise Router: Created packages/api/src/routers/exercise.ts with create, createMany, update, delete, and deleteByTraining mutations for exercises using protectedProcedure. All operations include proper authorization checks to ensure users can only modify exercises in their own trainings. Registered exercise router in packages/api/src/routers/index.ts. Linting passed, type checking passed.
2026-01-25 - Phase 2 Invite System: Created packages/api/src/utils/invite-code.ts with generateInviteCode and isValidInviteCode utilities using nanoid with safe alphabet (no ambiguous characters). Provides ~2.8 trillion possible combinations. Installed nanoid package.
2026-01-25 - Phase 2 Session Router: Created packages/api/src/routers/session.ts with start, end, join, leave, and updateAccess mutations using protectedProcedure. Implements invite code generation with collision detection, authorization checks (host-only operations), and proper error handling. Registered session router in packages/api/src/routers/index.ts. Linting passed, type checking passed, build succeeded.
2026-01-25 - Phase 2 Progress Router: Created packages/api/src/routers/progress.ts with record, update, delete, getBySession, and calculatePercentage operations using protectedProcedure. record mutation creates or updates exercise progress with completed reps array. Users can only modify their own progress. getBySession query returns all progress for a session with optional user filtering. calculatePercentage computes completion percentage comparing completed reps against target reps/sets. Registered progress router in packages/api/src/routers/index.ts. Linting passed, type checking passed, build succeeded.
2026-01-25 - Phase 2 Exercise Parser Router: Created packages/api/src/routers/exercise-parser.ts with AI-powered text-to-exercises parsing. Supports multiple formats: "10x4 pushup" (standard), "10,10,8,6 pull ups" (comma-separated reps), "5 sets of 10 pushups" (natural language), and handles weight (lbs/kg) and rest times. Includes parse mutation for preview and parseAndCreate mutation for direct database insertion with training ownership verification. Created comprehensive test suite in packages/api/src/routers/__tests__/exercise-parser.test.ts with 25 tests covering all patterns, edge cases, and real-world examples. All tests pass. Added test script to packages/api/package.json. Registered exerciseParser router in packages/api/src/routers/index.ts. Linting passed.
